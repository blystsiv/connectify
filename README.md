This project aims to create a video conferencing application similar to Google Meet. The application will use WebRTC and Node.js with React for the front end. It will allow users to stream audio and video in real-time, as well as chat with each other during the meeting. The application will include features such as screen sharing, muting and unmuting, and the ability to join meetings via a unique code. The UI will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate and control the meeting.
